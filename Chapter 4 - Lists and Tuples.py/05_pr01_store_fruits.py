# Q.1 Write a program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user.
f1 = input("Enter fruit number 1: ")
f2 = input("Enter fruit number 2: ") # by clicking alt we can make 2 cursors in vs code
f3 = input("Enter fruit number 3: ")
f4 = input("Enter fruit number 4: ")
f5 = input("Enter fruit number 5: ")
f6 = input("Enter fruit number 6: ") # ALT+SHIFT = Multiple cursors
f7 = input("Enter fruit number 7: ")
myFruitList = [f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7] # control+enter = without affecting this line you wull jump in the new line
print(myFruitList)

# list can take repetitive values
